## Welcome to my pseudo-hackathon project!
This document outlines the expectations, planning, and results of a coding challenge I undertook to build a small project from scratch in just 24 hours. It serves as a personal log of the tools I used, what I learned, interesting references, and reflections on the experience.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is solely for learning purposes. I take no responsibility or liability for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information provided here.

## Title  
**What to enter:** A short and memorable name for your project or challenge.  
**Purpose:** This should hint at the theme or main concept of your work.
```markdown
Spotify Unwrapped
```

## Duration
**What to enter:** The total expected time to complete the challenge (e.g., a day, weekend, or week).  
**Purpose:** Sets a clear boundary on how much time you plan to invest.
```markdown
Weekend
```

### Start date
**What to enter:** The start or planning date of your challenge.  
**Purpose:** Helps track when the project began.
```markdown
24-05-2025
```

## Aims
**What to enter:** A concise summary of the main purpose of the project.  
**Purpose:** Defines the core problem you're solving or the product you're trying to build.
```markdown
I want to build a program that allows you to input your credentials and quickly create a monthly Spotify wrapped like the official one
```

### Main goal
**What to enter:** A single, focused objective written using a formal goal-setting approach.  
**Purpose:** Clearly defines what success looks like for your challenge.
```markdown
A copy of one of the the current yearly statistics presented by Spotify in a similar layout. Produced from inputting the user credentials.
```

### Stretch goals
**What to enter:** Additional features or enhancements you’d like to implement if time allows.  
**Purpose:** Encourages ambition while keeping your main objective prioritized.
```markdown
1. An animated output generated dynamically from the data.
2. A brand new stat to add to the data.
```

### Out of Scope
**What to enter:** Tasks or areas you deliberately choose not to focus on.  
**Purpose:** Prevents scope creep and keeps the challenge realistic.
```markdown
I will not spend time developing any kind of input interface.
```

### Contrains (optional)
**What to enter:** Any self-imposed limitations besides time, such as required tools, frameworks, or data access rules.  
**Purpose:** Helps frame your approach and acknowledge real-world limitations.
```markdown
```

## Inpiration
**What to enter:** A short explanation of what motivated you to start this challenge.  
**Purpose:** Sets the creative or personal context for the project.
```markdown
To create an program attractive to the general public and to try a new library I found.
```

### Related Projects (optional)
**What to enter:** List any existing projects, tools, or codebases that inspired your challenge.  
**Purpose:** Helps provide references for learning or comparison.

# Planning
Start with a brief introduction to your overall planning approach.

## Wireframe
Do you have any initial designs, sketches, or diagrams for your project?  
Consider adding simple visual representations or layout ideas here.
```markdown
```

## Development
What are the key steps or phases you plan to follow during development?  
List the major tasks or milestones to track your progress.
```markdown
1. Connect to user profile.
2. Extract the relevant data.
3. Generate a image from the data.
4. Create an animated image.
5. Add new statistics to relevant data.
```

# Conclusions
Introduce your summary and reflections on the project once complete.

## Final Result
Provide an overview of the completed project or final deliverable.
```markdown
I managed to create a script that access the user account info and through some cheap shortcut is able to generate a video similar to the offical one.
```

### Screenshots
Do you have any screenshots, videos, or other media that showcase your result?  
Include them here to visually document your work.
```markdown
```

### What Works?
Which goals or parts of your objectives did you successfully achieve?  
Highlight your project’s strengths and accomplishments.
```markdown
I achieved the main goals and also achieved to generate a vidoe output instead of a static one.
```

### What’s Missing?
Which goals or aspects did you not manage to complete?  
Reflect on any gaps or features that remain unfinished.
```markdown
I couldn't add a custom statistic due to two reasons: the strict struture of the template left barely any room to add the statitists, and the API has been cutting developers from its features, making it hard to create.
```

### Tech Stack
What libraries, frameworks, tools, or technologies did you use during development?  
Summarize the key components of your technical environment.
```markdown
I used spotipy to access the API, and pyhton-ppxt for the static template. For the video generation shortcut I used playwright to emulate user input in the web interface.
```

## Retrospective  
This section reflects on your overall experience throughout the project, highlighting successes, challenges, surprises, and key lessons learned to improve future work.

### What went well?  
Reflect on the parts of the project that worked smoothly or exceeded expectations.
```markdown
Setting up a Spotify app and using the library was very smooth and if not hindered by the goal of generating a review it could have been fun to experiment.
```

### What was challenging?  
Describe the difficulties or obstacles you encountered during development.
```markdown
The lack of premade template for the wrapped format made me waste a considerable amount of time looking for ways to generate the output.
```

### Biggest surprises or blockers?  
Note any unexpected issues or revelations that impacted your progress.
```markdown
```

### What would you do differently next time?  
Consider improvements or alternative approaches for future iterations.
```markdown
```

### What lessons did you learn? 
Summarize the key takeaways and knowledge gained from this experience.
```markdown
I would not limit myself by trying to emulate the official template and probably would try to find an alterntive.
```
